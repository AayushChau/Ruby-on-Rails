# My Ruby on Rails Project

Welcome to my Ruby on Rails application! This project is designed to [briefly describe purpose or functionality].

## Features

- User authentication with Devise
- CRUD functionality for managing [items]
- Responsive design with Bootstrap
- API integration with [specific service]
- Test suite using RSpec

## Getting Started
Prerequisites:
Ruby:<br>
• Install Ruby (the version recommended by the official Rails documentation).<br>
• You can check if Ruby is installed by running `ruby -v` in your terminal. If not installed, use a version manager like `rbenv` or `rvm` to install it.<br>
• Rails works well with Ruby version 2.7 or higher, but it’s best to check the official Rails guide for the recommended version.<br>

<h3>Rails:</h3>
Rails is a Ruby gem, so you can install it using the command:

```bash
gem install rails
```
After installing Rails, you can verify the installation by running rails -v to check the version.<br>
<h3>Database</h3>

• Rails supports several databases, but the default is SQLite3 for development. To use it, you'll need to have SQLite installed.<br>
• For production, PostgreSQL or MySQL are popular choices.<br>
• You can install SQLite3 using a package manager like `apt`, `brew`, or `yum`, depending on your operating system.<br>

<h3>Node.js and Yarn (for managing JavaScript packages):</h3>

Rails uses Webpacker (for managing JavaScript) and it requires Node.js.
You can install Node.js from the official website or through a package manager.
Yarn can be installed via npm:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```
