# Ruby-on-Rails
A GitHub repository stores your project's code and history, enabling version control, collaboration, and sharing. For Ruby on Rails, it tracks changes, backs up your app, and allows teamwork through branches and pull requests. Itâ€™s a vital tool for managing, deploying, and showcasing your projects efficiently.

1. Create a New Repository
Go to your GitHub dashboard and click the green New button (or click Repositories > New).
Fill in the repository name, add a description, and choose visibility (public or private).
You can also initialize it with a README file and select a license.
2. Clone the Repository
Use Git to connect your local project to the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
3. Add Files
Add your project files to the folder.
For Rails, this will include the app's directory structure.
4. Commit and Push
Stage and commit your changes:
bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
5. Work with Branches
Create new branches for features or fixes:
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b new-feature
After making changes, push the branch and open a pull request.
6. Collaborate
Share your repo with collaborators or invite them under the Settings > Collaborators tab.
